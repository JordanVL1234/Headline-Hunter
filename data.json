        "content": "Apple\u2019s CEO Tim Cook is in India this week to open its first physical stores in the country, marking a milestone for the iPhone maker in the world\u2019s second largest smartphone market.\nCook was seen personally welcoming customers as employees cheered and clapped at the company\u2019s new outlet in Mumbai, which opened Tuesday. He is widely expected to appear at a second store opening in Delhi on Thursday.\nThe move comes as the world\u2019s most valuable company continues to pivot to India, eyeing its potential as both a consumer market and manufacturing base.\nIn a statement Monday, Cook pointed to Apple\u2019s ongoing expansion in the country, saying its brick-and-mortar launch coincided with its 25th year of operating there.\n\u201cIndia has such a beautiful culture and an incredible energy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to build on our long-standing history \u2014 supporting our customers, investing in local communities, and working together to build a better future.\u201d\nIn a separate statement Monday, Apple\n            \n                (AAPL) shared a peek of its new Mumbai store, located at a property owned by Reliance Industries, the conglomerate of Indian tycoon Mukesh Ambani.\nThe company bills the store as one of its \u201cmost energy-efficient\u201d in the world, saying solar panels allow it to run solely on renewable power.\nApple did not respond to a request for further comment, or details of Cook\u2019s visit.\nApple is the world\u2019s second biggest smartphone maker, behind Samsung\n            \n                (SSNLF), but its 6% share of the Indian market remains small.\nIt is dwarfed by the country\u2019s top five vendors, which are led by Samsung and Chinese smartphone makers Xiaomi and Vivo. Apple products are considered too expensive by many consumers in the country.\nIn India, the average salary for regular full-time workers is 18,585 rupees ($226.5) per month, according to the most recent government statistics. For comparison, an iPhone 14 starts at 79,900 rupees ($973.6), while an iPhone SE, a lower-cost model, starts at 49,900 rupees ($608.2).\nApple\u2019s position is expected to grow, however, as it continues to build out its retail presence there and more customers turn to high-end smartphones.\nIndia holds promise for businesses because of its vast population, rising middle class and growth potential from consumers who are expected to make the switch from basic cell phones to smartphones, according to Counterpoint Research Associate Director Hanish Bhatia.\nUntil now, however, Apple had been selling its products there online or through third-party resellers.\nThat\u2019s because the company, along with other foreign retailers, was restricted for years from setting up shop in the country unless they sourced at least 30% of raw materials locally, forcing them to rely on local partners. The Indian government eased restrictions in 2019.\nIn 2020, Apple launched an online store in India, allowing customers to buy its products and, for the first time, customize certain devices.\nApple had previously planned to open its first physical store in the country in 2021, though that was derailed by the Covid-19 pandemic.\nSanyam Chaurasia, a Canalys mobility analyst, said the stores would allow Apple to bring all its products \u201cunder one roof\u201d and guide more consumers toward purchases.\nThe premium category for smartphones, where Apple sits, \u201cis still driven by brick-and-mortar stores where consumers can touch [and] feel the device,\u201d he told CNN.\nPrachir Singh, a Counterpoint Research senior analyst, also said the locations of the new stores were critical, with Delhi and Mumbai each making up the top two Indian markets for Apple, respectively.\nMumbai, for example, typically contributes to 10% of overall iPhone sales in India, Singh said.\nApple first began making iPhones in India in 2017 and has been steadily ramping up its manufacturing there.\nIn recent months, it has notably expanded production in the country after suffering supply chain snags in mainland China, which accounts for the bulk of its smartphone manufacturing.\nApple increased its Indian exports significantly last year, with the number of iPhones made and shipped from the country rising 65% compared to the previous year, according to Counterpoint.\nTwo of Apple\u2019s top contract manufacturers, Foxconn and Wistron, were also the fastest-growing manufacturers in India during the last quarter of 2022, the firm said.\nLast month, Foxconn CEO Young Liu also spent a week in the country and met Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\nIn its statement Monday, Apple said the company was working with suppliers to \u201cproduce a growing number of components\u201d along with its assembly lines for iPhones.\n\u201cApple\u2019s work with Indian suppliers of all sizes supports hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country,\u201d it said.\nThe company\u2019s mobile apps business has also swelled to support more than 1 million developer jobs in the nation, it added.\nApple\u2019s increased activities in India are part of a broader trend of companies diversifying their manufacturing away from China.\nIn recent years, the south Asian nation has grown its share of global smartphone production significantly, from less than 10% in 2016 to almost a fifth projected this year, according to Counterpoint.\n\u2014 CNN\u2019s Manveena Suri contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Lyft\n            \n                (LYFT) plans to \u201csignificantly reduce\u201d its workforce, the company\u2019s new CEO David Risher told employees on Friday, in another round of layoffs as it struggles to turn a profit and pull off a turnaround.\nIn a company-wide memo, Risher said the cuts were aimed at making Lyft a \u201cfaster, flatter company where everyone is closer to our riders and drivers.\u201d\n\u201cI own this decision, and understand that it comes at an enormous cost,\u201d Risher continued. \u201cWe\u2019re not just talking about team members; we\u2019re talking about relationships with people who\u2019ve worked (and played) together, sometimes for years.\u201d\nThe announcement follows Lyft\u2019s move in November to cut 13% of its workforce, citing fears of a looming recession.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that the latest job cuts would eliminate at least 1,200 positions or upward of 30% of its staff. A Lyft spokesperson declined to provide details on the extent of the cuts.\n\u201cDavid has made clear to the company that his focus is on creating a great and affordable experience for riders and improving drivers\u2019 earnings,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cTo do so requires that we reduce our costs and structure our company so that our leaders are closer to riders and drivers. This is a hard decision and one we\u2019re not making lightly. But the result will be a far stronger, more competitive Lyft.\u201d\nLyft announced last month that Risher, an Amazon veteran, would take over as CEO in April, and that co-founders Logan Green and John Zimmer will step down from their management positions at the ride-hailing company.\nRisher was the 37th employee of Amazon \u2013 a company that has long been the model for the on-demand industry \u2013 and he went on to become the e-commerce giant\u2019s first head of product and head of US retail.\nFor Lyft and Risher, the current challenges are immense. While Uber diversified its business beyond ride-hailing by delivering meals and grocery items, Lyft never did. That arguably hurt the company earlier in the pandemic when fewer customers were traveling but more were ordering items online.\nNow Uber is showing renewed strength In its most recent earnings report, Uber said that it had its \u201cstrongest quarter ever,\u201d reporting a 49% year-over-year increase in revenue. Lyft\u2019s latest earnings report, meanwhile, was unusually disappointing for Wall Street.\nLyft shares were up 6% in midday trading Friday, but the company\u2019s stock is down roughly 70% over the past year.\n\u2013 CNN\u2019s Catherine Thorbecke contributed to this report.",
